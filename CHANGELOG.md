# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-13

Professionalization pass: the kit went from "code that works" to a real
public project — tests, CI, examples, docs, and a standalone identity.

### Added
- Full test suite: pure-node unit specs for `collision.js`, `hitbox.js` +
  `facing.js` (including the equivalence proof that a vectorized facing
  matches the classic X-signed cone bit-for-bit), and `settings.js`
  (storage-absent/throwing degradation, persistence, reset semantics), plus
  a browser smoke spec covering `index.html` and both examples.
- GitHub Actions CI running the unit suite on every push/PR to `main`.
- Two genre-neutral examples: `examples/topdown-8way.html` (top-down camera,
  8-way movement, melee arc, wall collision) and `examples/voxel-showcase.html`
  (six bespoke voxel builds, live quality-tier switching).
- `docs/API.md` — a hand-curated reference for every export in `src/`,
  including the implicit `world` contract.
- README screenshots ("See it" section) for the smoke test and both examples.
- `package.json` identity fields (`repository`, `author`, `license`) and a
  standalone description no longer framed as an extraction of a specific game.
- `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Changed
- README rewritten to stand on its own: leads with what the kit *is*, closes
  with a "Built with this kit" section linking an example project instead of
  a "lifted out of" provenance framing.

### Known limitations
- CI runs the pure-node unit suite only (44 assertions, <1s). The browser
  smoke test (`npm test`, full suite) needs a real GPU — GitHub's hosted
  runners don't have one, and headless Chrome + SwiftShader software
  rendering proved unreliable there across several attempts. Run `npm test`
  locally before tagging a release; see CONTRIBUTING.md.

## [0.1.0] — Initial extraction

The kit as pulled out of its origin game: renderer + HDR bloom/vignette/film
composer, voxel meshing with baked ambient occlusion, character-part
builders, particle and motion-smear FX, a WebAudio synth, localStorage-backed
settings, quality tiers, skybox/environment, and the two combat primitives
that motivated the extraction — swept AABB collision and a vectorized
(8-way) hitbox, first proven in real belt-scroller combat with `facingVec`
pinned to `±X`. No tests, no CI, no examples yet.
